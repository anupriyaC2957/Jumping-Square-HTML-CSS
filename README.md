The jumping square animation is achieved through CSS animations and keyframes. 
The main elements include a container, a wrapper with a rounded rectangular shape, a rubber element with a dynamic border-radius and vertical movement, stick-like structures on both sides with subtle rotation effects, and a square that performs a lively jumping motion. 
The square element's animation involves both vertical translation and rotation, creating a visually engaging and playful effect. 
The entire composition is designed to be centered within the viewport, providing an aesthetically pleasing and dynamic visual experience on the webpage.
